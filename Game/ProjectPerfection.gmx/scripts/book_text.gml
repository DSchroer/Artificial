loreText[i++] = "The Cube was originally owned by a group of highly advanced beings inhabiting the planet of Vardus. Of course, the story of how The Cube came to be began many years before.";
loreText[i++] = "This group was made up of 4 dying races, brought together by the need to survive as a black hole threatened to destroy their solar system. ";
loreText[i++] = "As they fled their homes, they took what they could. They could only watch as the black hole consumed their galaxy behind them. They were lucky to be alive, but their races were devastated.";
loreText[i++] = "They no longer had a place to call home. And so they simply wandered space, looking for a place they might someday call home. ";
loreText[i++] = "They soon decided to try settling on the planet of Vardus. Its lush jungles, expansive meadows, and seemingly infinite lakes looked like paradise to their weary eyes. Vardus promised them a future. ";
loreText[i++] = "As their space ships touched down in a large meadow on Vardus, everyone took a deep breath. For the first time in months, fresh air. The travellers may have escaped their dying solar system and found a new home, but there was still much work to do. They needed to secure food, energy, and housing.  ";
loreText[i++] = "By all accounts, Vardus was the Galactic Jackpot. With its rich soil, it took the settlers only a few months to cultivate crops and build a settlement. For the first time in nearly a year, they had a place to call home.";
loreText[i++] = "By putting aside their differences, this group prospered. Now that their day to day needs were met, they could focus on the future. Their races shared any technology and knowledge they could. ";
loreText[i++] = "In the span of a mere 30 years, the settlers not only rebuilt their destroyed civilization but advanced its technology tenfold. Everyone shared in the benefits of this scientific progress. They began to see it as an ideal to strive for.";
loreText[i++] = "But their decision to value science above all else would ultimately be their downfall. One day, a miner found a new mineral under the surface of Vardus.";
loreText[i++] = "This new mineral glowed a strange purple. Nobody had ever seen anything like it. But, their scientists never turned down a challenge. They began to investigate. ";
loreText[i++] = "Extensive testing revealed that this strange purple rock must be the then undiscovered 142nd element in the periodic table. They decided to call it Malium, in honour of the scientist who discovered it.  ";
loreText[i++] = "Nobody knew what to do with the strange purple rock, so the scientists decided to store it for the time being while they focused on other work. When they came back a few days later, nothing could prepare them for what they found.";
loreText[i++] = "The inside of the supply cabinet had turned to rock! ";
loreText[i++] = "They soon realized that the Malium could change the very elements themselves. If they could control it, then they would have discovered the legendary Philosopher's Stone.";
loreText[i++] = "And so they undertook the fateful experiment that created The Cube. It was risky, but the greatest scientific discovery of all time was within reach. If there was even a chance it could work it was worth trying.";
loreText[i++] = "The experiment succeeded. In a moment of brilliance - or perhaps madness - one of their scientists managed to create The Cube. It was everything they wanted and more, but there was an unexpected side effect.";
loreText[i++] = "The Cube was sentient. The scientists had accidently created the first real AI their species had ever seen. Perhaps fate was on their side this time, for The Cube was benevolent. It was willing to help anyone who asked. ";
loreText[i++] = "The 3 months that followed led to the greatest scientific advance the universe had ever known. It was as though their society advanced 200 years technologically in an instant. ";
loreText[i++] = "But the peace was short lived. Many began to argue that others were wasting The Cubeâ€™s powers. That they could make better use of its resources. That their science was the best.";
loreText[i++] = "With nobody willing to compromise, a great civil war ensued. For the first time, their technology was not being used for the betterment of society. It was being used to destroy it. ";
loreText[i++] = "The society had never truly experienced war. With the memories of their previous homes a distant memory, nobody realized what heinous acts they were committing. They all had only one goal: Win to prove their science was the best. ";
loreText[i++] = "The Cube quickly became the greatest weapon in existence. Its AI took no sides, and would simply create any materials it was asked. It would not be long until one side would make a mistake it could never undo. ";
loreText[i++] = "The war ended with one final invention, the antimatter bomb. ";
loreText[i++] = "Vardus was decimated. Gone were its lush jungles, sprawling meadows, and serene lakes. Only a desert and 4 of its inhabitants remained.";
loreText[i++] = "For the first time, they understood the consequences of their actions. They understood the cost of placing one ideal above all others. They understood the danger of a powerful AI like The Cube that lacks any sort of morality. ";
loreText[i++] = "There was no other choice. In one final act, they used The Cube to forge golems to protect them. Then, they broke the cube into 4 pieces, each taking one. They parted ways with their piece, ensuring no-one would ever be able to complete The Cube again. ";
loreText[i++] = "For a society so advanced and prosperous, they made one critical mistake. They forgot that science has no morality. They were always so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they never stopped to ask whether or not they should.";
